# What is Causality? 

  * History: 192? (Neyman, Wright)
  * causal relationalship: direction is unclear
  * Causality using an example, 
     Causal effect of treatment (A = 1 or 1; doesnt have to be binary) on some outcome (Y = 0 or 1 or time until death) 
  * Potential outcome: $Y^A$. For example, $Y^1$ = 1. This means the outcome (disease) under treatment (A = 1). This could be $Y^(A=0)$ = 0; Outcome under no treatment is no disease
 
## Counterfactual 
  * Observed outcome is Y = Y^1 ; counterfactual outcome is $Y^0$
